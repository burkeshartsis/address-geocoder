address-geocoder
================

A simple WordPress plugin for saving location data with Posts and Pages. Conveniently converts addresses to lat/lng from the Edit screen.

Storing addresses as lat/lng (rather than geocoding each time a user requests a page) decreases load time. This plug-in makes it easy for content managers to generate lat/lng, which is stored with the post as a custom field that can be accessed as part of the loop.

Uses the Google Maps JavaScript API V.3.
